# Stecagrid
Home Assistant custom integration for reading information from Steca StecaGrid inverters with proprietary RS485 protocol (Steca StecaGrid 8000+ 3ph)

This is still a work in progress, and being a complete rookie in this HA/python game makes this kinda try'n'catch project...

## Target
The project is meant to get current power production from a StecaGrid 8000+ 3ph solar inverter

## Method
I used a cheap LAN-to-RS485 converter so connect to the inverter https://raspberrypi.dk/produkt/rs485-til-ethernet-converter-til-eu/

## Credits
The physical connection I got information from here: https://svgroeneveld.blogspot.com/2015/08/communication-with-inverter.html

I got inspiration from this Arduino project: https://github.com/tsybolek/Aquarea_Stecagrid_Modbus_NodeMCU/blob/master/aquarea_steca_modbus_public.ino
