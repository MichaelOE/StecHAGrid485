# Stecagrid
Home Assistant custom integration for reading information from Steca StecaGrid inverters with proprietary RS485 protocol (Steca StecaGrid 8000+ 3ph)

This is still a work in progress, and being a complete rookie in this HA/python game makes this kinda try'n'catch project...

Target
The project is meant to get current power production from a StecaGrid 8000+ 3ph solar inverter

Method
I used a cheap LAN-to-RS485 converter so connect to the inverter

Credits
I got inspiration from this Arduino project: https://github.com/tsybolek/Aquarea_Stecagrid_Modbus_NodeMCU/blob/master/aquarea_steca_modbus_public.ino
